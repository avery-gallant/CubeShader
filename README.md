# CubeShader
Photosensitivity warning! Flashing colours when background is updating.

This is a demo/art thing i made to show off a shader idea, which blackens all colors above a certain brightness threshold.

Use arrow keys to move the cube around and WASD to move the light. W and S move it toward and away from the centre of the screen, A and D revolve it around the centre. Enable Show Light in the menu to make positioning easier.

TAB opens menu, and SPACE toggles background updating on/off.

Colours are fully customizable! Play around with the colour curves in the menu. They're a little buggy from the export to HTML5 but they still work alright. Background colours will match the gradient bar at the bottom of the curves editor
